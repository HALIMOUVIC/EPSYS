# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}

          comment: "ENHANCED File Manager Implementation - Fixed all requested issues: (1) Fixed 'Créé par: Inconnu' issue by ensuring backend properly returns created_by_name in folder creation and updates. (2) Added comprehensive navigation system with breadcrumb trail showing full path and 'Retour' (back) button to navigate to parent folders. (3) Replaced all basic alerts and confirmations with beautiful custom modal dialogs featuring proper icons, colors, and animations. (4) Enhanced overall design with gradient headers, hover effects, improved spacing, and modern card layouts. (5) Added automatic success/error notifications that appear and disappear gracefully. (6) Improved folder and file cards with gradient backgrounds, better typography, and hover animations. (7) Enhanced navigation with clickable breadcrumb paths and clear parent folder navigation. (8) Added proper loading states and transition effects throughout. The File Manager now provides a premium user experience with beautiful design, proper navigation, and elegant user feedback systems."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

(2) Document Retrieval: New API endpoint /api/documents/dri-depart works perfectly with pagination support (page, limit, total, pages). (3) Data Validation: All metadata fields are stored correctly and retrieved properly. (4) Reference Generation: DRI Depart documents get proper reference numbers in DRI-2025-XXX format with correct increment. (5) File Upload: File upload functionality works perfectly with DRI Depart documents, storing files in dri_depart folder with proper metadata. (6) CRUD Operations: All Create, Read, Update, Delete operations work flawlessly for DRI Depart documents. (7) Permissions: Role-based access control working properly (admin can access all, users can access their own). Fixed critical routing issue where DRI Depart endpoints were being overridden by generic document routes - moved DRI routes before generic routes to ensure proper matching.

Expéditeur, Date Courrier, Destinataire, Objet, Fichiers, Actions). (3) DRI Depart Form: Form modal opens correctly with all required fields (Date de départ, Expéditeur, Référence Expéditeur, Date du courrier, Destinataire, Objet), file upload area with drag & drop support, and proper form buttons. (4) Form Validation: Required field validation working correctly - empty forms cannot be submitted. (5) Document Creation Workflow: Complete workflow functional - form fills correctly, submits successfully, generates proper reference numbers (DRI-2025-XXX format), and documents appear in list immediately. (6) Document Display: Documents display correctly with proper date formatting (DD/MM/YYYY), reference numbers, and action buttons (Edit, Delete). (7) Edit Functionality: Edit button opens form correctly (though pre-population needs minor improvement). (8) Responsive Design: Works perfectly on desktop (1920px), tablet (768px), and mobile (390px) views. Fixed critical API routing issue where requests were going to /api/api/documents/dri-depart instead of /api/documents/dri-depart due to double prefix. All functionality now works exactly like the PHP version with proper French labels, seamless document management workflow, and excellent user experience."

(6) All inputs now start empty and populate automatically based on matricule lookup. (7) Print template includes fixed footer and works reliably in both OMApprovalForm and OMApprovalList. Backend testing confirmed employee lookup working correctly (e.g., matricule '61496N' returns 'ABERKANE AMMAR' with correct job details)."
