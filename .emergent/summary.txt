The previous AI engineer successfully developed the EPSys document management system from an initial MVP, progressively adding features based on user feedback. The trajectory details the implementation of core document workflows like Courrier Départ, Courrier Arrivé, OM Approvals, and DRI Départ, each with auto-generated references and dedicated storage. A significant focus was on refining OM Approval print functionality and integrating employee data auto-population. More recently, the engineer undertook a major overhaul of the File Manager, adding sophisticated features like user-tracked folder and file management, renaming, and preview capabilities, alongside significant UI/UX enhancements and French localization. Subsequently, a comprehensive Calendar system with event management and a revamped Settings page were introduced, leading to the current task of further refining Calendar delete functionality, ensuring all settings work, creating a dedicated Profile page, and implementing document counter and signup management within settings. The work flow is iterative, with the engineer frequently testing and obtaining user confirmation.

<product_requirements>
The EPSys application aims to digitize and manage various document types with specific workflows, providing user authentication and role-based access. It supports diverse file types (PDFs, Word, images, Excel) with local storage. Implemented workflows include:
-   **Courrier Départ:** Form, list,  references,  storage.
-   **Courrier Arrivé:** Form, list,  references,  storage.
-   **DRI Départ:** Form, list,  references,  storage, mirroring a PHP app.
-   **Approbation OM:** Form,  references,  storage, precise printable HTML output (A4, Sonatrach logo), auto-population of employee data by matricule (excluding ).
**File Manager:** Supports folder creation/editing, file uploads (with user tracking), deletion, renaming, search, hierarchical browsing, and file preview, mirroring a PHP file manager with enhanced UI/UX, custom alerts, and navigation.
**Calendar:** A comprehensive system for event management (create, edit, delete), with month/week/day views and a professional UI.
**Settings:** Comprehensive system for user preferences (notifications, security), system configuration, with the addition of auto-incrementing document counters and signup lock/unlock.
**Profile:** A dedicated page for user information, including photo and privacy settings, separated from general settings. All UI is in French.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack React.js (frontend) and FastAPI (backend) architecture with MongoDB.



-   : Core FastAPI application. Expanded with models/endpoints for Employee, DRI Depart, comprehensive File Manager (folder/file CRUD, user tracking, renaming, preview), Calendar (event CRUD), and Settings (user preferences, password, system info, document counters, signup management). Crucial for all data operations.
-   : Script to seed employee data.
-   : Defines application routing. Updated with routes for , , , , and .
-   : Main navigation. Updated links for DRI Départ, File Manager, Calendar, and Profile.
-   : OM Approval document creation. Updated print, employee data auto-population, and print template.
-   : OM Approval list. Updated reprinting functionality.
-   : New component for DRI Depart form. Handles form fields and multi-file upload.
-   : New component for DRI Depart list. Displays documents with pagination.
-   : Major enhancement. Implemented hierarchical folder/file browsing, creation, editing, deletion, user tracking, file renaming, file preview, custom alerts, and improved UI.
-   : Newly created. Implemented event creation, editing, and deletion (work in progress for deletion), month/week/day views, and a comprehensive event modal.
-   : Enhanced to integrate with backend settings APIs, updated to manage notifications, system preferences, and will include document counters and signup lock/unlock. Profile section removed to a dedicated page.
-   : Newly created. Intended for user profile management including photo, personal info, and privacy settings.
-   : Log of implemented features and testing outcomes. Continuously updated with backend and frontend test summaries, including for File Manager, Calendar, and Settings.

<pending_tasks>
The following tasks, requested in Chat Message 141, are currently pending completion:
-   Complete event deletion functionality in the Calendar component (frontend).
-   Ensure full functionality of Notifications and Système Préférences in Settings.
-   Fully implement the dedicated Profile page, including user photo and privacy settings.
-   Implement display and management of auto-incrementing document counters in Settings.
-   Implement option to lock/unlock signup in Settings.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on addressing a new set of user requests to enhance the Calendar and Settings modules, and to introduce a dedicated Profile page.

**Specifically, the work involved:**
1.  **Calendar Event Deletion:** The engineer began implementing the ability to delete events from the calendar. This involved adding delete buttons to the event views (day, week, month) within . The backend API for deleting events was already confirmed to be working.
2.  **Settings Functionality:** Work was initiated to ensure that the Notifications and Préférences système sections within the  component are fully functional and integrate with the backend settings APIs.
3.  **Dedicated Profile Page:**
    *   A new component, , was created.
    *   The  file was updated to include the routing for this new Profile page.
    *   The  navigation was modified to include a link to the new Profile page and remove profile-related elements from the user dropdown (to redirect to the new page).
    *   The  component was being refactored to remove the Profil section, as it will now reside on its own dedicated page.
4.  **Backend for Document Counters and Signup Management:** New backend endpoints were added in  to handle the logic for displaying and managing auto-incrementing document counters (for outgoing mail, incoming mail, DRI depart, approbation OM) and for controlling the signup lock/unlock feature.

The trajectory ends with the engineer in the middle of these implementations, specifically removing the Profile section from Settings.
