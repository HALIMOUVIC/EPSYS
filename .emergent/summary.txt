The AI engineer successfully built the EPSys document management system, starting with core document workflows and then enhancing modules like File Manager, Calendar, and Settings. The trajectory shows an iterative development process, with the engineer addressing user feedback systematically. Key technical efforts included implementing auto-generated references, refining printing, and significant UI/UX overhauls. Recent work focused on improving Calendar deletion, ensuring full Settings functionality, and creating a dedicated Profile page. The engineer also addressed critical issues like session management (fixing auto-logout and redirect), improving UI consistency (modernizing alerts, icons, and buttons), and resolving file download/preview errors by aligning frontend API calls with backend endpoints and addressing file path issues. The work consistently involved debugging, testing, and adapting to user-reported issues.

<product_requirements>
The EPSys application is designed to digitize and manage various document types with distinct workflows, supporting user authentication, role-based access, and diverse file types (PDFs, Word, images, Excel) stored locally. Key implemented workflows include:
-   **Courrier Départ**: Form and list views with  references, stored in .
-   **Courrier Arrivé**: Form and list views with  references, stored in .
-   **DRI Départ**: Form and list views with  references, stored in , mirroring a legacy PHP application.
-   **Approbation OM**: Form for  references, stored in , featuring precise printable HTML output (A4, Sonatrach logo) and auto-population of employee data.
-   **File Manager**: Provides hierarchical folder/file browsing, CRUD operations (create, edit, delete), user tracking, renaming, search, and file preview, with enhanced UI/UX and custom alerts.
-   **Calendar**: A comprehensive system for event management (create, edit, delete), supporting month/week/day views and a professional UI.
-   **Settings**: Manages user preferences (notifications, security), system configurations, document counters, and signup lock/unlock.
-   **Profile**: A dedicated page for user information, photo, and privacy settings, separated from general settings. The entire UI is localized to French.

<pending_tasks>
The following tasks are pending:
-   Apply the same modern design (icons, floating button, view modal, modern alerts) from  to  (incoming-mail).
-   Update the Dashboard page with design improvements.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of applying the modern design and enhanced functionality, which were successfully implemented in the DRI Depart module, to the  (outgoing-mail) component. This involves:

1.  **Refactoring **:
    *   Implementing a similar table structure with updated icons for Référence (Hashtag icon next to each reference) and removing icons from table headers.
    *   Replacing old action buttons with modern Heroicons ( for view,  for edit,  for delete).
    *   Integrating the new  system for success/error messages and confirmations, replacing native  and .
    *   Transforming the Nouveau Courrier button into a floating action button (FAB) at the bottom-right of the screen, consistent with .
    *   Integrating file preview functionality for attached documents within a dedicated view modal.

2.  **Creating **: A new component created to handle the detailed view of Courrier Départ documents, providing a scrollbar-less layout, file preview capabilities (PDFs, images, text), and download options.

The last action performed was updating the table structure of  to match the  design, indicating that the task is partially completed for . The engineer had just started working on applying these design changes, with  and Dashboard updates still remaining.
