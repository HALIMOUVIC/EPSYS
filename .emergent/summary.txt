The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and developed the EPSys document management system using a React, FastAPI, and MongoDB stack. The development process was iterative, responding to user feedback and progressively implementing features. Key achievements include a robust authentication system, general document handling, and specialized modules for Courrier Départ, Courrier Arrivé, and Approbation OM with auto-generated references and dedicated file storage. The engineer diligently addressed print functionality issues for OM Approvals, refined employee data auto-population for the OM form, and implemented the entire DRI Départ module, including backend APIs and frontend components, mirroring a provided PHP blueprint. The work also involved fixing deployment/preview issues and ensuring adherence to URL and environment variable guidelines. The most recent task initiated is the implementation of a comprehensive File Manager.

<product_requirements>
The EPSys application aims to digitize and manage various document types with specific workflows. Core features requested and implemented include user authentication with role-based access, support for diverse file types (PDFs, Word, images, Excel), and persistent local document storage.

Specific document workflows implemented:
-   **Courrier Départ (Outgoing Mail):** Form, list, auto-generated  references, and  storage.
-   **Courrier Arrivé (Incoming Mail):** Form, list, auto-generated  references, and  storage.
-   **DRI Départ:** Form, list, auto-generated  references,  storage. Implemented to mirror a PHP application's functionality.
-   **Approbation OM (Mission Order Approval):** Form for details, auto-generated  references,  storage, and a precise printable HTML output matching a PHP template, including specific A4 sizing and a Sonatrach logo. It also features auto-population of employee data (name, job title, division) based on matricule, with 'itineraire' remaining manually editable.

Additional modules include a central Dashboard, a dedicated File Manager with its own storage (), Internal Messaging, User Management (admin-only), and Settings. All UI elements and labels are in French. The File Manager is expected to support folder creation, file uploads, deletion, renaming, search, hierarchical browsing, and file preview, mirroring a provided PHP file manager.

<pending_tasks>
-   There are no explicitly pending tasks from the previous AI engineer in the provided trajectory, as the last completed task was the DRI Depart implementation.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate work being carried out before this summary request was the successful implementation of the DRI Départ (Outgoing DRI Mail) module. This involved:
-   **Backend ():** Creation of comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints for  documents, including logic for auto-generating unique reference numbers (e.g., ), handling multi-file uploads (with a 10MB limit per file), and implementing pagination.
-   **Frontend (, ):** Development of new React components for the DRI Départ form and list view. The form supports capturing details like Date de départ, Expéditeur, Référence Expéditeur, Date du courrier, Destinataire, and Objet, along with drag-and-drop file upload. The list component provides a tabular view with French headers, pagination, and actions for editing and deleting entries.
-   **Integration:** The new components and APIs were integrated into the existing application's routing () and navigation (), ensuring proper French localization and responsive design.

Both backend and frontend functionalities for DRI Départ have been thoroughly tested and declared fully working, mirroring the user-provided PHP reference for this module. The last successful value addition was the complete implementation and verification of the DRI Depart feature.
